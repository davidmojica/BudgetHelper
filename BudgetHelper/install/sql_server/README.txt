/*
You can include any SQL files you want in this folder. 
Any files in this directory will be run by the `q2 run_sql` command
in alphabetical order, so we recommend a naming convention such as:

01 - Setup.sql
02 - PopulateData.sql
03 - CreateUsers.sql
...

You may run the `q2 run_sql` command yourself and provide other credentials
to test on your own database

**This sql will be reviewed before installation into production.**

**To run these you will need pymssql installed in your environment.**
